#      I studied the foundational concept of neural networks and deep learning. By the end, I was familiar with the significant technological trends driving the rise of deep learning; build, train, and apply fully connected deep neural networks; implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks; identify key parameters in a neural networkâ€™s architecture; and apply deep learning to your own applications.

#    summary: |
#      Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me

I obtained my bachelor and master degrees in Mechanical Engineering from Politecnico di Milano (Milan, IT) in 2013 and 2015. I completed my Ph.D. in Bioengineering and Robotics at UniversitÃ  degli Studi di Genova (Genoa, IT) in 2020. Presently, I am a Post-doctoral Researcher at the [Artificial and Mechanical Intelligence Laboratory](https://ami.iit.it/it/), Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia (Genoa, IT).

My primary research focuses on the analysis and design of whole-body flight controllers for humanoid robots, specifically within the Aerial Humanoid Robotics research area. As the Scrum Master and technical coordinator of the [iRonCub](https://ami.iit.it/it/aerial-humanoid-robotics) group, my goal is to enable the humanoid robot iCub to attain flight capabilities.
