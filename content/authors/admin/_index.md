I obtained my bachelor and master degrees in Mechanical Engineering from Politecnico di Milano (Milan, IT) in 2013 and 2015. I completed my Ph.D. in Bioengineering and Robotics at UniversitÃ  degli Studi di Genova (Genoa, IT) in 2020. Presently, I am a Post-doctoral Researcher at the [Artificial and Mechanical Intelligence Laboratory](https://ami.iit.it/it/), Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia (Genoa, IT).

My current activity focuses on:

- Lead technical coordination and management (Scrum Master) of the [iRonCub](https://ami.iit.it/it/aerial-humanoid-robotics) team, a multidisciplinary group developing a jet-powered humanoid robot for disaster response.

- Implementing automatic tuning of flight controllers using Reinforcement Learning; analyzing and designing whole-body flight controllers for humanoid robots.

- Co-tutor Ph.D. candidates and M.Sc. students in areas including robot force/torque control, aerodynamics, trajectory planning, jet engines and sensor modeling, hardware design and co-design strategies.
