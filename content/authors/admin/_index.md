I received the bachelor and master degrees in mechanical engineering from the Politecnico di Milano (Milan, IT), in 2013 and 2015, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in bioengineering and robotics from Universit√† degli Studi di Genova (Genoa, IT) in 2020. I am currently a Post-doctoral Researcher at the Artificial and Mechanical Intelligence Laboratory, Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia (Genoa, IT). His main research interests include the design of control algorithms for floating base systems, with a focus on aerial humanoid robotics. He is the Scrum Master of the [iRonCub]((https://ami.iit.it/aerial-humanoid-robotics)) Group (IIT), which pursues the objective of making the humanoid robot iCub fly.
